#Intro to Data Science

##*Analyzing the NYC Subway Dataset*

### A Project made while taking Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

**The Dataset:** NYC subway turnstile entry data, merged with weather data.

**The Question:** Do more people ride the subway when the weather is bad?

**Comment:** The strict language of statistical analysis challenged me at first, but I learned that I need to think rigorously on what the data really conveys.

**Technologies Used:** python, numpy, pandas, pandasql, ggplot, scikit-learn, linear regression, gradient descent, mapreduce, sql queries
